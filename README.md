## Projects
### Mapping my Train Routes

I am currently tracking my train routes with GIS Softwares, for commuting from Copenhagen to France or for travelling. My overall goal is to spread awareness that it is possible to travel by train all around Europe.

### NeoCamp

NeoCamp is a start-up that develops alternative equipment for festivals, designed to be environmentally friendly and long-lasting. Our business model revolves around collaborating with festival organisations that aim to minimise their environmental impact and campsite waste. We offer turnkey production, rental, and installation services for camping equipment within the campsites. Once the rental period ends, we collect the products, clean them, and make any necessary repairs.

The startup was founded in 2022 by Danilo Paciotti and myself, with the goal of providing festivals with dependable, durable, and sustainable camping equipment available for rent. Ultimately, our vision enables the reduction of waste generated by festival-goers. [Access Website](https://www.neocamps.com/)
